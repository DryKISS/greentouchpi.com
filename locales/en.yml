      Our treatments are the ultimate in pampering, relaxation and pain

      and relax. Green Touch can tailor a massage that is right for you.
      <br><br>

      We start off by offering you tea or water to unwind. Then before
      your massage a hot towel for your feet and finally the massage of
      your choice.
      <br><br>

      Please do always communicate with us or your therapist should the pressure
      be too much, or you feel any pain.
