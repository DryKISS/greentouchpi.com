            Our treatments are the ultimate in pampering, relaxation and pain remedy. Whether itâ€™s a
            problem area causing you trouble, or just the stress of the working day, take advantage
            of a therapeutic deep tissue full body massage or focus on one area to de-stress, unwind
            and relax. Green Touch can tailor a massage that is right for you. <br />
            <br /> We start off by offering you tea or water to unwind. Then before your massage a
            hot towel for your feet and finally the massage of your choice. <br />
            <br /> Please do always communicate with us or your therapist should the pressure be too
            much, or you feel any pain. <br />
            <br /> We highly recommend booking in for at least a 90 minutes massage.{' '}
